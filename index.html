            I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
            current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
            got every penny&#8217;s worth.

            “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.
            I&#8217;ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some
            people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free
            intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
            thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling -
            time of my life. Since completing the course, I&#8217;ve
            successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a
            VR startup. ”

            Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.
            Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was
            easy.

            “ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find
            really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to
            be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
            junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the
            personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart
            and amazing people. ”

          <p class="review">
            “ Before joining the bootcamp, I&#8217;ve never written a line of
            code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me
            learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a
            former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
            program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They
            were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The
            agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
            learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever
            have. In fact, I&#8217;ve often referred to it during interviews as
            an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land
            a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
            100% recommend! ”
